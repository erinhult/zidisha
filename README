Zidisha Analysis files:

I’ve included in this directory some of the files used to analyze lender retention and balancing borrowing and lending levels for a three week project as an Insight Data Science Fellow. Data was from a local dump of Zidisha’s SQL database. The analysis was done primarily in IPython Notebook, and was exploratory in nature. 

IPython Notebooks with plot images can be viewed online here:
